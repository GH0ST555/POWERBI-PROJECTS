# PROJECTS

These code snippets are used in my Inventory Management Application Using Oracle Application express.

There are two main user classifications for the APP:
1.> QA User--> These are users who belong to the QA department who are responsible for the borrowing and return of items required for site visits.has the ability to approve/deny requests, view the item inventory , view entire request history, view QA tailored dashboards and create requests.

2.> Reg User --> Users of all other departments. has the ability to create request and approve/deny requests.


several snippets of critical features have been adde to the branch for easy viewing and feel free to use this code as i see very limited solutions online and several of these features will greatly improve functionality of the app.

some features that have been invented i cannot share as it uses apex interface such as google sso for example.

The application uses several coding languages such as SQL, PL/SQL, Javascript, CSS to add functionality along with a RDBMS linked using foreign keys.
